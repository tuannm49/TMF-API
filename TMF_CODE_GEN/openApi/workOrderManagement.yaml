                each of which can be assigned to a corresponding set of attributes in a
                CharacteristicSpecification object. The values of the attributes in the
                CharacteristicValueSpecification object describe the values of the attributes that a
                corresponding Characteristic object can take on.

            EntitySpecification is a class that offers characteristics to describe a type of entity.
            Entities are generic constructs that may be used to describe bespoke business entities
            that are not effectively covered by the existing SID model.

            Functionally, the entity specification acts as a template by which entities may be
            instantiated and described. By sharing the same specification, these entities would
            therefore share the same set of characteristics.

            Note: The ‘configurable’ attribute on the specCharacteristics determines if an entity
            instantiated from the entity specification can override the value of the attribute. When
            set to false, the entity instance may not define a value that differs from the value in
            the specification.

            A tax exemption certificate represents a tax exemption granted to a party (individual or
            organization) by a tax jurisdiction which may be a city, state, country,... An exemption
            has a certificate identifier (received from the jurisdiction that levied the tax) and a
            validity period. An exemption is per tax types and determines for each type of tax what
            portion of the tax is exempted (partial by percentage or complete) via the tax
            definition.
