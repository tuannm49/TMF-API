    **TMF API Reference : TMF 701 - ProcessFlow API**

    **Release : 21.5 - October 2021**

    ProcessFlow API provides capabilities to define design-time process specification & task specification by using the ProcessFlowSpecification and TaskFlow Specification and then runtime to manage process execution via the resources ProcessFlow & TaskFlow. This API allows to:

    **Design Time Use**
    • Define ProcessFlow Specification to describe a business process (as done via a BPMN modeler)
    • Define TaskFlow Specification to describe business task (define related entity specification, characteristic to be managed, role ,etc...)
    • Associate TaskFlow Specification ProcessFlow Specification (a TaskFlow Specification could be used in several Process Flow Specification)
    • Retrieve and get information about ProcessFlow Specification and TaskFlow Specification

    **ProcessFlowSpecification**
    A process flow specification is a definition of a process flow (as ProductSpecification is for Product). This resource is used by modeler designer to track a process design from a draft design to 'ready to be use' process flow.

    ProcessFlow API performs the following operations on a ProcessFlowSpecification:
    - Create a Process Flow Specification 
    - Retrieve and Get information about Process Flow Specification
    - Update Process Flow Specification
    - Delete Process Flow Specification
    - Notification of Process Flow Specification event

    **TaskFlowSpecification**
    A task flow specification is a definition of a task flow. This resource is used by modeler designer to define a task specification (for example to define the characterstic to be valued for this task specification).

    ProcessFlow API performs the following operations on a TaskFlowSpecification:
    • Create a Task Flow Specification 
    • Retrieve and Get information about Task Flow Specification
    • Update Task Flow Specification
    • Delete Task Flow Specification
    • Notification of Task Flow Specification event   

    **Run Time use**
    • Create a Process Flow (an instance of a processFlowSpecification). 
    • Get information about next task flow to be achieved in this process.
    • Provide information to complete a taskflow (via an update information).
    • Get information about processFlow and taskFlow execution in progress.

    **ProcessFlow resource**
    A process flow resource allows to manage an **instance** of a processFlow (usually managed on a bmpn tool but could be hardcoded). A processFlow will manage a list of taskFlow(s). A ProcessFlow is an instance of a ProcessFlowSpecification

    ProcessFlow API performs the following operations on a ProcessFlow:
    - Retrieval of a ProcessFlow or a collection of ProcessFlow depending on filter criteria
    - Creation of a ProcessFlow (from a processFlow type)
    - Deletion of a ProcessFlow (for administration purposes)
    - Notification of events on ProcessFlow .

    **TaskFlow resource**
    A taskFlow is one specific **instance** of a task of a process. A TaskFlow may need human intervention to be completed (data capture). TaskFlow is a ProcessFlow subResource (A taskFlow cannot be independant from a processFlow). A taskFlow is an instance of a TaskFlowSpecification. A taskFlow is a ProcessFlow subResource.

    Process Flow API performs the following operations on a task Flow:
    - Retrieval of a TaskFlow or a collection of TaskFlow (for a processFlow) depending on filter criteria(s)
    - Create an instance of a TaskFlow 
    - Partial update of a TaskFlow 
    - Notification of events on TaskFlow .
