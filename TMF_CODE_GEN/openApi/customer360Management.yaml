            An identification of an entity that is owned by or originates in a software system
            different from the current system, for example a ProductOrder handed off from a commerce
            platform into an order handling system. The structure identifies the system itself, the
            nature of the entity within the system (e.g. class name) and the unique ID of the entity
            within the system. It is anticipated that multiple external IDs can be held for a single
            entity, e.g. if the entity passed through multiple systems on the way to the current
            system. In this case the consumer is expected to sequence the IDs in the array in
            reverse order of provenance, i.e. most recent system first in the list.
